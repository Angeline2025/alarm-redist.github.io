It conducts\nresearch into redistricting sampling algorithms, best practices and\nworkflows for redistricting analysis, and tools to visualize, explore,\nand understand redistricting plans. ALARM Project researchers develop redist,\nan open-source R package for redistricting simulation and analysis which\nimplements state-of-the-art MCMC and SMC redistricting sampling\nalgorithms. The package allows for the implementation of various\nconstraints in the redistricting process such as geographic compactness\nand population parity requirements, and includes tools to compute\nvarious summary statistics and create useful plots.\nPeople\nBen Fifield, American Civil Liberties Union\nGeorge Garcia III, Department of Economics,\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nKosuke Imai, Departments of Government and\nStatistics, Harvard University\nChristopher Kenny, Department of Government,\nHarvard University\nShiro Kuriwaki, Department of Political Science,\nStanford University\nSho Miyazaki, Keio University\nCory McCartan, Department of Statistics, Harvard\nUniversity\nEvan Rosenman, Harvard Data Science Initiative\nTyler Simko, Department of Government, Harvard\nUniversity\nSam Thau, Harvard College\nKevin Wang, Harvard College\nMelissa Wu, Harvard College\nKento Yamada, Harvard College\nRei Yatsuhashi, Harvard College\nAnna Yorozuya, University of Tokyo\nPublications\nAutomated\nRedistricting Simulation Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Journal\nof Computational and Graphical Statistics (2020) Vol. 29, No. 4,\npp. 715-728.\nThe\nEssential Role of Empirical Validation in Legislative Redistricting\nSimulation Statistics and Public Policy (2020) Vol. 7,\nNo. 1, pp. 52-68.\nSequential Monte\nCarlo for Sampling Balanced and Compact Redistricting Plans\nThe use of\ndifferential privacy for census data and its impact on redistricting:\nThe case of the 2020 U.S. Census Science Advances (2021)\nVol. 7, No. 41.\nRelated R Packages\nblockpop:\nEstimate Census Block Populations for 2020.
