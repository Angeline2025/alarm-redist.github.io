It conducts research into\nredistricting sampling algorithms, best practices and workflows for\nredistricting analysis, and tools to visualize, explore, and understand\nredistricting plans.\nALARM Project researchers develop redist,\nan open-source R package for redistricting simulation and analysis which\nimplements state-of-the-art MCMC and SMC redistricting sampling algorithms. The\npackage allows for the implementation of various constraints in the\nredistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity\nrequirements, and includes tools to compute various summary statistics and\ncreate useful plots.\nPeople\nCurrent Membership\nAneetej Arora, Ohio State University\nEmma Ebowe, Department of Government, Harvard University\nBen Fifield, Meta\nJennifer Gao, Harvard College\nKosuke Imai, Departments of Government and Statistics, Harvard University\nChristopher T.
