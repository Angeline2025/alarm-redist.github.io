It conducts\r\nresearch into redistricting sampling algorithms, best practices and\r\nworkflows for redistricting analysis, and tools to visualize, explore,\r\nand understand redistricting plans. ALARM Project researchers develop redist,\r\nan open-source R package for redistricting simulation and analysis which\r\nimplements state-of-the-art MCMC and SMC redistricting sampling\r\nalgorithms. The package allows for the implementation of various\r\nconstraints in the redistricting process such as geographic compactness\r\nand population parity requirements, and includes tools to compute\r\nvarious summary statistics and create useful plots.\r\nPeople\r\nCurrent Membership\r\nAneetej Arora, Harvard College\r\nEmma Ebowe, Department of Government, Harvard\r\nUniversity\r\nBen Fifield, Meta\r\nJennifer Gao, Harvard College\r\nKosuke Imai, Departments of Government and\r\nStatistics, Harvard University\r\nChristopher T.
