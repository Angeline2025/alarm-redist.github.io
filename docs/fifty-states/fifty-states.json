The goal\nof the 50-State Simulation project is to enable researchers,\npractitioners, and the general public to use cutting-edge redistricting\nsimulation analysis to evaluate enacted Congressional districts.\nOver the past few years, academic researchers, including those on the\nALARM Project, have\ndeveloped redistricting simulation algorithms. These algorithms can be\nused to obtain a representative sample of alternative plans one could\ndraw under each state’s rules for drawing districts. The comparison of\nan enacted plan with these sampled alternative plans can reveal the\nextent to which the enacted plan is likely to yield extreme partisan,\nracial, or other outcomes.\nOur mission is to bring these modern redistricting simulation\nalgorithms to researchers, policy makers, data journalists, and citizen\ndata scientists. The ALARM project has developed an open-source software\npackage redist to\nsimulate and analyze alternative plans under any redistricting criteria\ntailored to the user’s analysis goals. We have also developed a set of\nnew tools that facilitate the efficient workflow including data\ningestion, preprocessing, diagnostics, visualizations, and\npost-simulation analyses. The 50-State Simulation Project demonstrates\nhow to use all of these tools in a unified workflow in the context of\neach state, and provides a set of 5,000 alternative plans for each\ncongressional (and later, state legislative) redistricting plan.\nOur simulation analyses should serve as a realistic template for\nthose who are interested in conducting their own analyses. Our code can\nbe modified and extended, and the resulting samples can be used to\nexplore various properties of potential plans under the specific\nredistricting criteria of our analysis. Our simulations presented here,\nhowever, do not represent our evaluation of the\nlegality of the enacted and other plans. Any such evaluation of\nthe enacted plan would require the interpretation of relevant laws.\nAlthough some requirements are relatively straightforward to interpret\nand operationalize (e.g., minimizing splits of administrative\nboundaries), others such as compliance with the Voting Rights Act\nrequire legal justifications. For this reason, we do not claim that the\nanalyses presented here are necessarily applicable when evaluating the\nlegality of redistricting plans.\nWhy are simulations useful?\nEvaluating a redistricting plan requires analysts to take into\naccount each state’s redistricting rules and particular political\ngeography. Comparing the partisan bias of a plan for Texas with the bias\nof a plan for New York, for example, is likely misleading. Comparing a\nstate’s current plan to a past plan is also problematic because of\ndemographic and political changes over time. Simulations generate an\nensemble of alternative redistricting plans within a given state which\nare tailored to its redistricting rules. Unlike traditional evaluation\nmethods, therefore, simulations are able to directly account for the\nstate’s political geography and redistricting criteria.\nWhere can I find the code, data, and simulated\nplans?\nFor each state, we release 5,000 alternative plans, according to our\nbest approximation of each state’s redistricting rules. The code used to\ngenerate the simulated plans is also available so that others can use it\nas a template to generate their own simulated plans under different\nspecifications. The major outputs are posted on the ALARM\nProject Dataverse, and the code is available on GitHub. We have\nalso developed a package, alarmdata, which makes it easy to\ndownload and work with the simulation outputs in R. An overview of the\nentire project and the methodology can be found in our data paper.\nOutput File\nWhat is it?\n*_map.rds\nA redist_map R object.

We explain how to interpret graphs\nwith examples below.\nExpected number of seats\nIn each state, we average across several statewide elections from\n2016-2020, and represent the range of the expected number of districts\nwon by a party with a histogram. In Oregon, for example, Democrats are\nexpected to win about 3.5 out of the 6 congressional districts under\nsimulated plans. This is close to proportional representation of their\nstatewide vote of 3.3 Democratic seats. In contrast, under the enacted\nplan, the Democratic party is expected to win as many as 4.2 seats. Less\nthan 1% of simulated plans would yield the same or higher expected\nnumber of Democratic seats as the enacted plan. The histogram ranges\nfrom 3.5 to 4.5, which tells us that the Democrats would likely not be\nable to consistently win 5 seats under Oregon’s geography, legal\nconstraints, and recent performance in statewide elections, regardless\nof the plan. A takeaway from this histogram is that although the\nmajority party usually wins more seats than proportional representation,\nthe enacted map is a statistical outlier in the degree of that\nDemocratic advantage.\n\nElection results by districts\nIn addition to the statewide, we can also compare the enacted plan\nwith the simulated plans at the district level. We first order the\ndistricts of the enacted plan by the variable of interest. For example,\nto evaluate district level Democratic vote in Oregon with 6 districts,\nwe sort the districts from the least Democratic (ordered district 1) to\nthe most Democratic district (ordered district 6). We repeat this for\neach of the simulated plans. Once the districts are sorted for both the\nenacted and simulated plans, we use a dot to represent the Democratic\nvote percent for each ordered district of a simulated plan. For the\nenacted plan, we use a black horizontal line. This allows visual\ncomparison between the enacted and simulated plans. In the example\nbelow, the enacted plan appears to pack Republicans in the most\nRepublican district (1), while making the second most Republican\ndistrict (2) barely Democratic. Again, the number on the x-axis does not\ncorrespond to the actual district number under the enacted plan.\nInstead, it represents the order of districts sorted by the variable of\ninterest for each plan. The variable of interest is then made into the\ny-axis.\n\nPartisan bias metrics\nWe measure the partisan bias of a plan in two ways: the efficiency\ngap and the deviation from partisan symmetry. The efficiency gap of a\nplan is the difference in the two party’s wasted votes as a fraction of\nthe statewide turnout. It is a measure of packing and cracking. If a\nDemocrat won a district with 60% of the vote, then each vote above 50% +\n1 of the total votes are wasted because the district could have won by\n50% + 1 votes. Similarly, if a Democrat loses a district with 45%, then\neach of those votes are wasted because those votes did not lead to a\nseat. The efficiency gap for Democrats shown in the histogram is the\nDemocratic wasted votes minus the Republican wasted votes. Thus,\npositive values indicate a pro-Republican bias whereas a negative value\nindicates a pro-Democratic bias. In the Oregon plan, the gap is -0.10,\nmeaning that Democratic votes are wasted at a much smaller rate than\nRepublican votes.\n\nAnother measure we use is deviation from partisan symmetry in the\nseats-votes curve. Suppose a plan leads to 60% Democratic seats when\ntheir statewide vote share is 55%. If the map satisfies partisan\nsymmetry, the Republican seat share should also be 60% if they win 55%\nof the votes in another election. We represent the deviation\nfrom partisan symmetry by computing the excess Republican seat share\nabove 50% when their vote share is 50%. This measure is typically called\nthe “partisan bias” of a plan in the academic literature on\nredistricting. In the Oregon example below, the 0.1 deviation from\npartisan symmetry means that in a 50-50 election, the plan allocates 60%\nof seats to the Republicans, rather than the symmetric outcome of 50% of\nseats. While the enacted plan is more favorable towards the Republican\nparty than a plan that exhibits partisan symmetry (a value of 0), it\nstill favors the Democratic plan more than the modal simulated plan\n(around 0.18 on the histogram).\nTraditional Redistricting Criteria\nThe histograms for compactness and counties split compare the enacted\nand expected maps in the same way as partisan metrics. We measure\ngeographic compactness with the Polsby-Popper compactness score of each\ndistrict, and take its average across districts. Polsby Popper scores\nrange from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a circle. The “counties split”\nmeasure is the number of counties which are not wholly contained within\na single district. In the Oregon example, the enacted plan is near the\ncentral tendency of the alternatives in terms of compactness. However,\nit splits 11 counties whereas the alternative plans only split up to 6\ncounties.\n\nWhat\nare the redistricting rules used to generate simulated plans?\nWe have documented the rules we used to simulate our alternative\nplans. All simulated plans will be contiguous, respect population\nequality, and are at least somewhat compact. Many states have their own\nspecific rules, which we attempt to follow. The set of constraints used\ndepends on the state’s redistricting rules.\nHard county splitting constraint: Unless otherwise\nnoted, a simulated plan will split fewer counties than the number of\ndistricts.\nHard population constraint: Congressional districts\nmust be roughly equal in population, so all state simulations contain a\nuser-specified cap on the maximum deviation of any one district from the\ntarget population, which is the total statewide population divided by\nthe number of districts. This deviation is 0.5% of the target population\nor less, except when a state explicitly specifies a maximum.\nCompactness constraint: Unless otherwise noted, the\nalgorithm nudges towards compact districts by an adjacency-graph-based\nmeasure of compactness, the fraction of edges kept.\nMunicipality splitting constraint: In some states,\nthe simulations avoid splitting municipalities within large counties\nmany times to preserve political subdivisions.\nVRA constraint: In some states, the simulations are\nencouraged to accept plans that have a concentrated minority share of\nthe voting age population or citizen voting age population, in\naccordance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nDisclaimers\nFor consistency, reference plans, such as the 2010 or 2020\nenacted plans, are best matched to the VTD or tract level. Reference\nplans often split a few of these at the block level. This may have a\nvery small impact on estimated metrics.\nVRA compliance requires substantial information, including a\nracially polarized voting analysis and knowledge of local history. For\nthe purposes of this project, we target the number of\nminority-opportunity districts as in the enacted plan. We check\napproximate performance of these districts. Simulation results can\nchange if different VRA constraints are imposed.\nConstraints are based on our interpretation of the law, but we\nare not lawyers. We do our best to follow the requirements and choices\nmade by states.\nAny suggestions for improving the analysis, including legal\ninterpretation of statutory requirements are welcome and should be\nsubmitted as a\nGitHub issue.\nData Sources and\nAvailability\nUnless otherwise noted, data for each state comes from the ALARM\nProject’s 2020\nRedistricting Data Files, which use U.S. Census demographic data (in\nthe public domain) and election data from the Voting\nand Election Science Team, which is licensed under a CC BY 4.0\nlicense. In these cases, shapefiles are also taken from the U.S. Census\nBureau.

    "contents": "\n\n\nEvery decade following the Census, states and municipalities must\nredraw districts for Congress, state houses, city councils, and more.\nThe goal of the 50-State Simulation Project is to enable researchers,\npractitioners, and the general public to use cutting-edge redistricting\nsimulation analysis to evaluate enacted congressional districts.\nEvaluating a redistricting plan requires analysts to take into\naccount each state’s redistricting rules and particular political\ngeography. Comparing the partisan bias of a plan for Texas with the bias\nof a plan for New York, for example, is likely misleading. Comparing a\nstate’s current plan to a past plan is also problematic because of\ndemographic and political changes over time. Redistricting simulations\ngenerate an ensemble of alternative redistricting plans within a given\nstate which are tailored to its redistricting rules. Unlike traditional\nevaluation methods, therefore, simulations are able to directly account\nfor the state’s political geography and redistricting criteria.\n\nLearn more about the\nproject and our methodology »\nRead the data\npaper »\n\nYou can dive into our analyses straightaway by clicking on a state\nbelow. From there, you’ll be able to see how the state’s new\ncongressional districts stack up compared to a set of 5,000 simulated\nplans.\n\n\n\n\nStates colored  blue  have enacted a\ncongressional map and been fully analyzed, states colored  gray  have enacted a\nplan but haven’t yet been analyzed, or just have a single district (and\nhence no redistricting), and states colored  red  haven’t enacted\na plan yet.\n\nAnalyzed States\n\n\n\nAlabama\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nColorado\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nIowa\n\n\nKansas\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nMaine\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\nMontana\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\nNew York\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nOhio\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOregon\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nUtah\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\nWashington\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\n\n\nFor each state, we release 5,000 alternative plans, according to our\nbest approximation of each state’s redistricting rules. The code used to\ngenerate the simulated plans is also available so that others can use it\nas a template to generate their own simulated plans under different\nspecifications.  The major outputs are posted on the ALARM\nProject Dataverse, and the code is available on Github.). We\nhave also developed a package, alarmdata, which makes it easy to\ndownload and work with the simulation outputs in R.\n\nDownload the\ndata »\n\nOur simulation analyses should serve as a realistic template for\nthose who are interested in conducting their own analyses. Our code can\nbe modified and extended, and the resulting samples can be used to\nexplore various properties of potential plans under the specific\nredistricting criteria of our analysis. Our simulations presented here,\nhowever, do not represent our evaluation of the\nlegality of the enacted and other plans. Any such evaluation of\nthe enacted plan would require the interpretation of relevant laws.\nAlthough some requirements are relatively straightforward to interpret\nand operationalize (e.g., minimizing splits of administrative\nboundaries), others such as compliance with the Voting Rights Act\nrequire legal justifications. For this reason, we do not claim that the\nanalyses presented here are necessarily applicable when evaluating the\nlegality of redistricting plans.\nData Sources and\nAvailability\nUnless otherwise noted, data for each state comes from the ALARM\nProject’s 2020\nRedistricting Data Files, which use U.S. Census demographic data (in\nthe public domain) and election data from the Voting\nand Election Science Team, which is licensed under a CC BY 4.0\nlicense. In these cases, shapefiles are also taken from the U.S. Census\nBureau. The U.S. map here, scaled to reflect Congressional\nrepresentations, is courtesy of https://dkel.ec/map.\nAll data is available on our Dataverse and has been\nreleased to the public domain. Code is available on GitHub under an\nMIT license.\nThank you to the Harvard Data Science Initiative and Microsoft for\ncomputational support.\n\n\n\n",
