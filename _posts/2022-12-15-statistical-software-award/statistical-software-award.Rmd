Last week, `redist` received this year's Statistical Software Award from the Society for Political Methodology.


We are grateful for the honor! Thank you to the award committee for considering our software.

`redist` is an open source R package for sampling redistricting plans, [available here](https://alarm-redist.org/redist/).
